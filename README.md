# HELLO-WORLD
This was part of a tutorial on Friday 11th May 2018 
Roger is editing the READMME.MD a bit as part of the tutorial, on the first day.  In order to commit these, apparently I have to press "Commit".  The button is at the bottom here;  it does give the option to place the commit into a new branch but i am going to stick to the first branch "readme-edits" initially.
